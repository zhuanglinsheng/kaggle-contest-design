       " 'Overview': ['# Background\\n\\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual competition broadcast worldwide which is open to entrants from active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\\xa0 This is not defined by Europe\\'s geographical bounds; for example Israel and Cyprus compete in the contest.\\xa0 This year\\'s contest is being held in Oslo, Norway.\\xa0 The location is usually the country of the previous year\\'s winner.\\xa0 The number of entrants changes on a yearly basis, due to flux in EBU membership, political shifts such as the dissolution of the Former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and desire (or lack thereof) of countries to participate.\\xa0 \\xa0<br /><br />Each country must submit one song to represent it, which must not have been previously commercially released.\\xa0 All songs are, however, made public by a deadline several weeks before the contest, and this year\\'s entrants are all known already with details such as title, language and artist included in the database provided.\\xa0\\xa0 Since 1999 songs may be sung in any language, whereas prior to this point (up to 1998 inclusive) songs had to be sung in one of the entrant country\\'s national languages.<br /><br />Although the voting format has changed over time, the modern positional voting system has been in place since 1975.\\xa0 Voting countries award scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 to competitors, with 12 allocated to the favourite song.\\xa0 Each score can only be awarded once; ie: each voting country can only allocate scores to 10 countries, with all other countries automatically allocated a score of 0.\\xa0 These scores are then added up to determine a competitor\\'s final score.\\xa0 No country can vote for itself.<br /><br />Although mass televoting has been the primary mode of final voting since its implementation in 1998, each country also has a back-up jury in the event of failure of the televoting system.\\xa0 Some countries also supplement televotes with sms votes.<br /><br />Despite the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, the four same countries - Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and France - automatically qualify for the final each year.\\xa0 This means that they do not compete in the semi-final.\\xa0 Additionally, the host country - this year, Norway - is also exempt from performing in the semi-final, automatically qualifying for the final.\\xa0 However, these five countries do vote in the semi-final, specifically France, Germany and Spain in semi-final 1, and United Kingdom and Norway in semi-final 2 this year. <br />\\n----------------------\\n# Custom\\n\\n<b>Hint 1</b><br />We suggest browsing\\xa0Dr. Tim Cocx\\'s\\xa0\\'Analysis on the Eurovision Songcontest\\' available at <a href=\"http://www.liacs.nl/%7Etcocx/songfestival/indexenglish.html\" mce_href=\"http://www.liacs.nl/~tcocx/songfestival/indexenglish.html\">http://www.liacs.nl/~tcocx/songfestival/indexenglish.html</a>.\\xa0 It contains an interesting document - a \\'Distance matrix\\' - which\\xa0represent an abstract (non-geographic) distance that denotes how many points the countries awarded one another in past contests, where a shorter distance implies higher exchanged scores and a larger distance\\xa0implies\\xa0fewer exchanged points.\\xa0 You may consider it worth utilising or producing your own, up-to-date, version based on a similar concept<br /><br /><b>Hint 2</b><br />One way to approach this competition might be to work out that country A normally allocates country B between 4 and 10 votes (with the precise score depending on the performance\\'s quality). Once you have determined these ranges for all countries, you can use betting market data as a proxy for performance quality. <br /><br /><b>Hint 3</b><br />If you\\'re thinking about augmenting our dataset, you may be want to try and track down data on expatriate populations in each voting country.<br />\\n----------------------\\n# Custom\\n\\nThank you to Stephanie Wayne for putting this competition together.<br /><br />We would also like to thank Betfair Pty Ltd for supplying\\xa0betting prices\\xa0data\\n----------------------\\n# Description\\n\\n<B>The intrigue of Eurovision - the modeller\\'s delight</B><BR /><BR />Since its inauguration in 1956, the Eurovision Song Contest has transfixed millions of viewers worldwide with its bubblegum pop, quirks, ballads and flops.\\xa0 During its tenure as one of the world\\'s longest-running television programs, it has attracted its fair share of controversy, with claims that the voting outcomes don\\'t simply reflect performance quality but are influenced by factors such as regional politics, expatriate populations, alliances, and artists\\' sexual appeal.\\xa0 Patterns have appeared over time which support this hypothesis. <BR /><BR />Contestants will attempt to exploit these patterns in order to predict the voting for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. <BR /><BR /><B>Down to the details</B><BR /><BR />We will provide you with publicly-available data on variables we have deemed potentially important, such as historical voting patterns, betting odds, song details and artist details.\\xa0 You are welcome to supplement this with any data you believe will improve the accuracy of your model.<BR /><BR />As the voting method for the Contest has changed over time, we will supply \\'Finals\\' data from 1998 when the current \"televoting\" format was implemented, and \\'semi-finals\\' data from 2004 when semi-finals were introduced.\\xa0 We will detail Eurovision\\'s voting procedures and their minor changes/exceptions pertinent to the provided data in the \\'Data\\' page of this competition. <BR /><BR />Your entry will involve submitting a matrix of the individual votes of each voting country for the competitor countries. <BR /><BR /><B>What is your incentive to enter?</B><BR /><BR />There will be a cash prize of USD1000 for the contestant who produces the most accurate predictions. And just as the Contest has launched the high-flying careers of its own performers - notably ABBA and Céline Dion - creating a strong model for this competition will land you a top ranking as a modeler on the Kaggle website.\\n----------------------\\n# Evaluation\\n\\n<P>Evaluation will be performed using the \\'Absolute Error\\' method.\\xa0A submission\\'s absolute error is calculated by summing the absolute difference between predicted and actual votes.\\xa0 A low score implies a small deviation of predicted votes from actual votes; a higher score implies a larger difference between predicted votes and actual votes.\\xa0\\xa0The most accurate prediction has the lowest Absolute Error score.\\xa0 <BR /><BR />Here is an example of how \\'Absolute Error\\' evaluation works:<BR /><BR />Predicted voting (submitted by contestant X)<BR />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Norway<BR />France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01<BR />Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02<BR />Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00</P>\\n<P><BR />Actual voting<BR />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Norway<BR />France\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02<BR />Moldova \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01<BR />Norway\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa00 </P>\\n<P>Contestant\\xa0X\\'s Absolute Error score,\\xa0working row-by-row, would be calculated as follows:\\xa0<BR />Absolute Error(X) = abs(0-0) + abs(1-1) + abs(2-1) + abs(1-2) + abs(0-0) + abs(1-2) + abs(2-1) + abs(2-2) + abs(0-0)<BR />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1+ 0 + 0<BR />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 = 4 </P>\\n----------------------\\n# Prizes\\n\\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2010 forecasting competition will award a prize of US$1000 to the winning entrant.<br />The prize money will only be awarded once the winner has sent a brief description of the methodology employed to generate his/her submission.\\n----------------------\\n# SubmissionInstructions\\n\\nSubmissions\\xa0must be made using the\\xa0template attached.<br /><br />The countries listed in column one are the competitors in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 final. The countries listed in row one are the voting countries. Only 25 of these 39 competing (column one) countries will progress from the semi-finals to the final, however each voting country listed in (row one) will vote in the final.\\xa0 <br /><br />Your task effectively involves  two steps:<br />1. Firstly you must predict which 25 countries will make it to the final. Keep in mind that\\xa0Spain, United\\nKingdom, France, Germany and Norway\\xa0are guaranteed final competitors.<br />2. Once you have chosen your 25 finalists you must predict the voting (ie who will vote for who). Make sure you only allocate votes to the 25 countries you predict will make the final. <br /><br />Submissions will only be accepted if each voting country (in row one) has allocated all its votes once to the potential final competitors (in column one), ie:\\xa0the scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 have been allocated exactly once per voting country.<br />Submissions with scores other than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 or 12 will not be accepted.<br />Submissions will only be accepted if votes are allocated to ≤ 25 countries.\\xa0 Submissions with votes allocated to > 25 countries will not be accepted. Note: all 39 countries vote regardless of whether or not they make the final. <br /><br />Each\\xa0contestant may only enter with one submission. However, a contestant can delete and replace their submission at any time up until the competition\\'s deadline. <br /><br />As exemplified by the example submission, please ensure that there are no blank cells; instead, where no vote is allocated, enter a \\'0\\'.<br /><br />Note: you can open CSV files with Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice for more human-friendly viewing. <br />'],\n",

Moldova, Russia, Estonia, Slovakia, Finland, Latvia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Belgium, Malta, Albania, Greece, Portugal, Macedonia, Belarus, Iceland<br /><i>Semi-final 2</i> - Lithuania, Armenia, Israel, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Georgia, Turkey<br /><i>Straight to final</i> - Spain, Norway, United Kingdom, France, Germany<br /><br /><b>Voting procedure in semi-finals<br /></b><br />Semi-finals were introduced in 2004.\\xa0 There was one semi-final every year from 2004-2007, and two semi-finals per year for 2008 onwards (including this year).\\xa0\\xa0 <br /><br />As explained in the \\'Background\\' sheet, a \\'positional voting\\' system is used, whereby each voting country must allocate scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 to competitor countries.\\xa0 Only the countries competing in that semi-final vote, the exception being the 5 countries which automatically qualify for the final.\\xa0 In 2008, Germany and Spain voted in semi-final 1; France, United Kingdom and Serbia voted in semi-final 2.\\xa0 In 2009, Germany and United Kingdom voted in semi-final 1; France, Spain and Russia voted in semi-final 2.\\xa0 This year, France, Germany and Spain will vote in semi-final 1; Norway and United Kingdom will vote in semi-final 2.<i><br /><br />Voting procedure for 2004-2007</i> - the top 10 from the previous year\\'s final and this year\\'s semi-final would qualify for this year\\'s final.\\xa0 (eg: in 2004, the final contestants were the top 10 from 2004\\'s semi-final plus the top 10 from 2003\\'s final.)<i><br />Voting procedure for 2008-2009</i> -
